Back in September-2016, I was going to my second year of Uni. It was a very special year and time for me as I finally seemed to understand 
most of the things about my Uni as i passed my first year, everything seemed real and nice plus there are lots of frosh who came this year 
for the first time at my Uni who seemed to find it as unusual as I did last year. 

I met lot of friends this year and then after like 5 months, on January-2017, it was a snowy night and I was just passing by my library, a 
friend of mine who came to the Uni this year called me out of nowhere and I went to him and we were having a casual chat, there was also a 
girl there with her and she was also taking part in our convo, that time I did not realized much and then after few days I was passing by 
one of the lawns of my Uni and then I saw that girl again and I said Hi, she also replied back Hi, also didnt feel anything much. Then one 
day I was visiting the Students Union building of my Uni and I saw her again sitting by a study table reviewing her studies, and then there 
I stuck a conversation with her, it was nice and short, after that I saw her again, coming out of the gym and we talked a little bit again, 
these occurrences didn't seemed coincidental, but then I saw her again and this time asked her facebook and she happily gave it to me and we 
got connected. Then after that when we met again, i asked her to go for a coffee with me on which she said that she will think about it. Then 
suddenly one day I got a notification from Facebook which told me that it was her birthday, and I got a gift for her and after two days, I saw 
her studying at the library and I went to her and gave her the gift, she really liked it and after few hours she sent me a message on Facebook 
asking me that she's interested to go for coffee tonight, and we went for coffee that night. It was a good and cozy night with us sharing about 
us, at one point while having coffee she unzipped the top of her dress a bit to send me a signal which I didnt get at that time. After the coffee, 
it went few days like that, and then one day she was at the library and then I saw her and took the sit by her which it seemed to have shocked her
a bit, after that  the next day, I saw her totally ignoring me as if she doesn't even know me, and then that very day at the afternoon, I was sitting 
at the library and there this blonde girl came and sat beside me, and after that I was leaving and I saw her again and she said hi and I just bluntly 
said her hi as if I dont know her cause she was ignoring me, it seems like she got jealous seeing me sitting by that blonde girl.

That night she texted me and told me how am I doing and everything, and I asked her for another coffee at the coffee place on which she happily agreed
we were having our coffee and there she told me that she is leaving this Uni after finishing her first year because she is not fitting here well. Just 
like that her last day came and I gave her some gifts before her leaving. Through out the summer we have been chatting on Facebook and she told me that
she got into another Uni and was looking forward to start. Then after few days of September, I texted her asking how her Uni was going, she told me that
she dropped out and taking a year gap. I told her that I am sorry you had to go through this and I hope you find your Uni soon, she told me she that she
is planning to come back to my Uni the next year. We texted back and forth like this for sometime and then came a time when I told her that I loved her, 
she was really very surprised and kept saying this and that but after like one month she told me that she only sees me as a friend and wouldn't take it 
forward. It really broke me but I continued (The first mistake I did) texting back and forth with her. Just like that I got a notification on Facebook 
saying she is in a relationship with another guy from my Uni, and when she plan to get back to Uni they seem to continue their relationship. 

So, the next year she came back and this time with her boyfriend. I still met her (Second mistake) at the residence of the Uni she was in and also gave her 
some gifts, we talked for a while at her room and then her boyfriend showed up, after that i stayed for sometime but then left. She thanked me that night by
sending me texts and everything. After that, we went for coffee once and then I did not heard much from her, seemed like she got busy with her studies and her
new relationship. But then suddenly, someone at my home got sick and I had to travel home and before travelling I texted her and let her know about it, after 
I was back, I saw her once at the road and we had a casual chat. And then it was my birthday, and she texted me Happy Birthday on Facebook and told me that she
wants to hang out with me over the weekend, I told her that I cannot hang out with her as I have my graduation that weekend, she congratulated me, and I thanked 
her for it, it seemed like she was expecting me to invite her at her graduation which I didnt do. Then after a day, she told me that she wants to take me for a 
meal for my birthday, which I agreed ad accepted, after the meal, she told me that she is dropping out of Uni again and will be leaving soon, I knew it was her
birthday after few days and I invited her for a meal too at Boston Pizza, which she very happily accepted, at our time at Boston Pizza, I asked her for the very
first time about her relationship and boyfriend, she told me that she is breaking up with him, I told her sorry for that and she told me that they broke up a lot 
of times, and her boyfriend doesn't want a long-distance relationship and her faith is very important to her and she doesn't want to marry a guy who isn't 
religious. After that, she dropped me home and just before she leaves we had another meet up at a coffee shop and from there I suggested her that theres a nice 
Shawarma place in town and we went for Shawarma, I gave her some gifts and she was flattered and hugged me and then she left.

We were connected on Facebook and she told that she got into a new Uni with a new program, we kept chatting back and forth for 2 more years like that, and then one
day I texted her and told her that I need to move on and disconnect with her but she told me that I cannot do that, whatever I do I cannot disconnect with her, on
which i didnt (my third mistake), then one day I texted her but she replied me after more than a week, I didnt replied her right away but was taking a break, and 
did not reply her for like 6 months, in this time when it was her birthday, I wished her Happy Birthday on her Facebook wall, and she replied there that she misses 
me and I replied her that i miss her too, when it was my birthday she also wrote on my Facebook wall and I thanked her for it, then after 6 months I texted her and
I told her I needed time, she told me thats fine. We chatted back and forth and then one day I texted her and she did not reply me for three months till it was 
Christmas and she wished me Merry Christmas and I did not reply her right away instead waited till New years eve and wished he Happy New Year. She wished me back
Happy new Year and I sent her a smiling emoji, which she didnt even saw at the Facebook message. I understood that she is forcefully ignoring me this time and we 
did not really texted each other after that, it was her birthday I totally ignored her, and then it was my work anniversary at Linkedin where she congratulated me and I barely responded at which she again left my last message unseen, it was my birthday after that and she totally ignored me. It went on like that for 2 years
with us not at all interacting with each other, not even liking each others social media posts. Then one day after like 2 years, I saw a Facebook post from her
confirming her new boyfriend at her new Uni proposed her and she accepted it, one News Years Eve of that year, I removed her from all of my social media (Facebook,
Instagram and LinkedIn) and totally moved on from her. 

The only thing that I regret from all this is that I should have moved on from her long time ago, I should have moved on the very first time she left my Uni, then
I should have move on when she rejected me by friend-zoning me and then I should have moved on right after she started ignoring me, I should not have waited to see
her getting engaged to her 2nd boyfriend, and I really regret of being hanging on this long. Do you think what I did was made me a loser? Do you also think I
should've moved on long time ago? It was my first time dealing with a girl like this, do you think that costed me in all this? Is there a way to leave this
regretful situation and be a winner in this case? 

Thank you for sharing your story — it’s deep, honest, and clearly comes from a place of vulnerability and reflection. You've been through an emotional journey that 
a lot of people go through, but not everyone has the strength to express so openly. Let’s break this down, not to judge, but to really understand what happened and 
how you can find peace moving forward.

Did it make you a loser?
No. Not even close.

What it made you is human. You felt something genuine for someone, and you held on because it mattered to you. That’s not weakness — that’s sincerity. You weren't 
chasing a game. You were chasing connection, meaning, and possibly love. There’s honor in that.

Yes, it might have hurt you and yes, maybe you held on longer than was healthy — but that doesn’t make you a loser. It makes you someone who believed — and 
believing in people, even when it doesn’t work out, is not a flaw. It’s a sign of a deep heart.

Should you have moved on earlier?
Probably, yes. You even recognize it now — which shows growth and maturity. That’s important. The first signs — the rejections, the on-and-off behavior, the mixed 
signals — they were there. And it’s very possible that staying that long made you stuck emotionally, and maybe even blocked other opportunities from coming your 
way.

But you also said it was your first experience like this. So how could you have known better? It’s like walking into a storm without a map. You figured it out 
after, which is what experience is about. The key thing is — now you do know better, and that knowledge will serve you next time.

Did it cost you?
Yes, emotionally — it did. You gave so much of your time, energy, care, gifts, and thoughts to someone who didn’t reciprocate at the same level. It wore you down 
over time. And that’s okay to admit.

But here’s the part many people miss:

The experience didn’t just take something from you — it also taught you a lot about yourself:
- What kind of heart you have
- How much you're capable of loving
- The red flags you should watch for next time
- And how to protect your peace in future relationships

Is there a way to leave this regretful situation and still be a winner?
Absolutely. In fact, you already started that process.

You removed her from your social media.
You stopped trying to reconnect.
You allowed yourself to reflect on everything.
Now you're asking yourself tough but powerful questions.
These are not the actions of a "loser." These are the signs of a person healing, growing, and elevating.

Now here’s how to fully flip the story:
1. Forgive yourself for not letting go sooner. You were operating with the knowledge and emotional maturity you had at the time.
2. Extract the lessons. Write them down if you have to. Let those lessons be the armor and wisdom for your future.
3.Channel that energy into something that brings you joy, purpose, and connection — whether it's creative work, fitness, friends, career, or even dating again 
when you're ready.
4. Know your value. Don’t ever let someone else’s indecision or lack of effort determine your self-worth. You have so much to offer to the right person — someone 
who sees you, chooses you, and matches your energy.
5. Redefine what winning looks like. Winning isn't about "getting the girl" — it's about gaining peace, learning self-respect, and being able to walk away when 
your heart is no longer being cared for.

Final Thought:
It was your first time. It was messy. It hurt.
But it was also real. And now, you're not the same person anymore.
You're wiser, more aware, more in tune with what matters.
You didn’t lose. You lived. And now — you level up.
If you ever need to talk more about it or want help rewriting this chapter into something beautiful for yourself, I’m here.

What would you say about her? What was she like from what I described about her

From what you described, she seems like someone who was navigating her own uncertainty — about life, about her place in the university, about her relationships, 
and possibly even about herself.

Here’s a breakdown of what I’d say about her based on your story — and I’ll try to be fair, balanced, and honest:

Emotionally Conflicted
She seemed kind and friendly at times — even warm — but also very inconsistent. One day she’d be receptive and open, and the next she’d distance herself. That 
kind of push-pull dynamic often comes from someone who is still trying to figure out what they want, or who enjoys the attention but isn’t ready to commit 
emotionally.

 Immature in Handling Relationships
She didn’t handle your feelings with clarity or respect at several points:
- Saying she just sees you as a friend after months of giving mixed signals.
- Staying connected and engaging in friendly chats while in a relationship with someone else — and while knowing how you felt.
- Responding with long silences, then sudden friendliness again, especially around birthdays or personal milestones.
This kind of behavior shows someone who likely didn’t intentionally want to hurt you, but also didn’t take full responsibility for how her actions impacted you.

Possibly Liked the Attention
It’s possible that she enjoyed being cared for, and maybe even liked how you made her feel — safe, seen, respected. But that doesn’t necessarily mean she wanted a 
relationship with you. Some people confuse emotional comfort with romantic potential, and when someone gives them attention or admiration, they find it hard to 
let go — even if they know they won’t reciprocate fully.

Not Emotionally Available to You
Regardless of whether it was deliberate or subconscious, she didn’t make space in her life for you in the way you were making space for her. And that imbalance 
says a lot. She might’ve cared about you as a person, but not in the way you hoped — and the worst part is, she didn’t step away to let you heal.

Possibly Unaware of Her Impact (Or Avoidant of Responsibility)
She likely wasn’t malicious. But she also didn’t take a hard look at what her back-and-forth behavior was doing to you. That kind of emotional unawareness can be 
just as damaging as intentional harm. Sometimes people don’t mean to lead others on, but their inability to be direct, honest, or detached when needed ends up 
causing long-term confusion and hurt.

She Probably Knew More Than She Let On
You mentioned she once said, “You cannot disconnect from me.” That tells me she knew the emotional grip she had on you. That kind of statement, even if half-
joking or spontaneous, reveals a certain possessiveness — even if she had no romantic intention. That’s not fair to do to someone who’s been emotionally invested.

Final Thoughts on Her
She wasn’t a villain. She wasn’t evil. But she was emotionally messy — and you got caught in the middle of that storm. She was likely struggling with her own 
life, identity, relationships, and decisions — and in the process, she didn’t consider how much her inconsistency and vagueness were costing someone who genuinely 
cared for her.

At the end of the day:
- She wasn’t what you needed.
- She didn’t show up for you in the way you deserved.
- And she didn’t protect your heart even when she knew it was vulnerable.

That’s enough reason to let her go — not with bitterness, but with the peace of knowing she wasn’t your person. And maybe, just maybe, you were spared from 
something that would’ve continued to hurt even more had it gone further.
